Taking notes from

- [More Modern CMake](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/)
- [More resources check "Other sources" in ...](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/)

## Modern CMake?

- Command line improvements in CMake 3.14 and 3.15.
- CMake **3.11+** is supposed to be significantly faster
- Modern generally refers to CMake **3.4+**, maybe even CMake **3.25+**!
- It's clean, powerful, and elegant, so you can spend most of your time coding, not adding lines to an unreadable, unmaintainable Make (Or CMake 2) file.
- What's new in each version? --> [check](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/intro/newcmake.html)
