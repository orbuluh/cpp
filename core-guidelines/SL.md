# SL: The Standard Library
- Using only the bare language, every task is tedious (in any language). Using a suitable library any task can be reasonably simple.
- The standard library has steadily grown over the years. Its description in the standard is now larger than that of the language features.

## SL.1: Use libraries wherever possible
- Save time. Don't re-invent the wheel. Don't replicate the work of others. Benefit from other people's work when they make improvements. Help other people when you make improvements.

# SL.chrono: Time
- `<chrono>` (defined in namespace `std::chrono`) provides the notions of `time_point` and `duration` together with functions for outputting time in various units.
- It provides clocks for registering `time_points`.
