# CP.con: Concurrency
This section focuses on relatively ad-hoc uses of multiple threads communicating through shared data.
- For parallel algorithms, see [parallelism](CP.par.md)
- For inter-task communication without explicit sharing, see [messaging](CP.mess.md)
- For vector parallel code, see [vectorization](CP.vec.md)
- For lock-free programming, see [lock free](CP.free.md)
