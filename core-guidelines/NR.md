# NR: Non-Rules and myths

- This section contains **rules and guidelines that are popular somewhere, but that we deliberately don't recommend.**
  - We know perfectly well that there have been times and places where these rules made sense, and we have used them ourselves at times.
  - However, in the context of the styles of programming we recommend and support with the guidelines, these "non-rules" would do harm.

- Even today, there can be contexts where the rules make sense.
  - For example, lack of suitable tool support can make exceptions unsuitable in hard-real-time systems, but please **don't na√Øvely trust "common wisdom" (e.g., unsupported statements about "efficiency");** such "wisdom" might be based on decades-old information or experiences from languages with very different properties than C++ (e.g., C or Java).
- The positive arguments for alternatives to these non-rules are listed in the rules offered as "Alternatives".

## NR.1: Don't insist that all declarations should be at the top of a function
- The "all declarations on top" rule is a legacy of old programming languages that didn't allow initialization of variables and constants after a statement.
- This leads to longer programs and more errors caused by uninitialized and wrongly initialized variables.

- The larger the distance between the uninitialized variable and its use, the larger the chance of a bug.
- Fortunately, compilers catch many "used before set" errors. Unfortunately, compilers cannot catch all such errors and unfortunately, the bugs aren't always as simple to spot as in this small example.
- **Alternative**: Always initialize an object


## NR.2: Don't insist to have only a single return-statement in a function
- The single-return rule can lead to unnecessarily convoluted code and the introduction of extra state variables.
- In particular, the single-return rule makes it harder to concentrate error checking at the top of a function.

```cpp
template<class T>
//  requires Number<T>
string sign(T x)
{
    if (x < 0)
        return "negative";
    if (x > 0)
        return "positive";
    return "zero";
}
```
- to use a single return only we would have to do something like
```cpp
template<class T>
//  requires Number<T>
string sign(T x)        // bad
{
    string res;
    if (x < 0)
        res = "negative";
    else if (x > 0)
        res = "positive";
    else
        res = "zero";
    return res;
}
```
- This is both longer and likely to be less efficient. The larger and more complicated the function is, the more painful the workarounds get.
- Of course many simple functions will naturally have just one return because of their simpler inherent logic.

```cpp
int index(const char* p)
{
    if (!p) return -1;  // error indicator: alternatively "throw nullptr_error{}"
    // ... do a lookup to find the index for p
    return i;
}
```
- If we applied the rule, we'd get something like

```cpp
int index2(const char* p)
{
    int i;
    if (!p)
        i = -1;  // error indicator
    else {
        // ... do a lookup to find the index for p
    }
    return i;
}
```
- Note that we (deliberately) violated the rule against uninitialized variables because this style commonly leads to that.
- Also, this style is a temptation to use the goto exit non-rule.
- **Alternative: Keep functions short and simple. Feel free to use multiple return statements (and to throw exceptions).**

## NR.3: Don't avoid exceptions
- There seem to be four main reasons given for not using exceptions:
  - exceptions are inefficient
  - exceptions lead to leaks and errors
  - exception performance is not predictable
  - the exception-handling run-time support takes up too much space

- There is no way we can settle this issue to the satisfaction of everybody.
  - After all, the discussions about exceptions have been going on for 40+ years. Some languages cannot be used without exceptions, but others do not support them. This leads to strong traditions for the use and non-use of exceptions, and to heated debates.

- However, we can briefly outline why **we consider exceptions the best alternative for general-purpose programming** and in the context of these guidelines.
  - Simple arguments for and against are often inconclusive. There are specialized applications where exceptions indeed can be inappropriate (e.g., hard-real-time systems without support for reliable estimates of the cost of handling an exception).

- Consider the major objections to exceptions in turn

- **Exceptions are inefficient:**
  - Compared to what? When comparing make sure that the same set of errors are handled and that they are handled equivalently.
  - In particular, do not compare a program that immediately terminates on seeing an error to a program that carefully cleans up resources before logging an error.
  - Yes, some systems have poor exception handling implementations; sometimes, such implementations force us to use other error-handling approaches, but that's not a fundamental problem with exceptions.
  - When using an efficiency argument - in any context - be careful that you have good data that actually provides insight into the problem under discussion.

- **Exceptions lead to leaks and errors.**
  - They do not. If your program is a rat's nest of pointers without an overall strategy for resource management, you have a problem whatever you do. If your system consists of a million lines of such code, you probably will not be able to use exceptions, but that's a problem with excessive and undisciplined pointer use, rather than with exceptions.
  - In our opinion, you need RAII to make exception-based error handling simple and safe -- simpler and safer than alternatives.

- **Exception performance is not predictable.**
  - If you are in a hard-real-time system where you must guarantee completion of a task in a given time, you need tools to back up such guarantees. As far as we know such tools are not available (at least not to most programmers).
  - The exception-handling run-time support takes up too much space. This can be the case in small (usually embedded) systems.
  - However, before abandoning exceptions consider what space consistent error-handling using error-codes would require and what failure to catch an error would cost.
  - Many, possibly most, problems with exceptions stem from historical needs to interact with messy old code.

- The fundamental arguments for the use of exceptions are
  - They clearly differentiate between erroneous return and ordinary return
  - They cannot be forgotten or ignored
  - They can be used systematically

- Remember
  - Exceptions are for reporting errors (in C++; other languages can have different uses for exceptions).
  - Exceptions are not for errors that can be handled locally.
  - Don't try to catch every exception in every function (that's tedious, clumsy, and leads to slow code).
  - Exceptions are **not for errors that require instant termination of a module/system after a non-recoverable error.**

- Alternative:
  - RAII
  - Contracts/assertions: Use GSL's Expects and Ensures (until we get language support for contracts)


## NR.4: Don't insist on placing each class declaration in its own source file
- The resulting number of files from placing each class in its own file are hard to manage and can slow down compilation.
- Individual classes are rarely a good logical unit of maintenance and distribution.
- Alternative: Use namespaces containing logically cohesive sets of classes and functions.


## NR.5: Don't use two-phase initialization
- Splitting initialization into two leads to weaker invariants, more complicated code (having to deal with semi-constructed objects), and errors (when we didn't deal correctly with semi-constructed objects consistently).

```cpp
// Example, bad
// Old conventional style: many problems

class Picture {
    int mx;
    int my;
    int* data;

  public:
    // main problem: constructor does not fully construct
    Picture(int x, int y) {
        mx = x; // also bad: assignment in constructor body
                // rather than in member initializer
        my = y;
        data = nullptr; // also bad: constant initialization in constructor
                        // rather than in member initializer
    }

    ~Picture() { Cleanup(); }

    // ...

    // bad: two-phase initialization
    bool Init() {
        // invariant checks
        if (mx <= 0 || my <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (data) {
            return false;
        }
        data = (int*)malloc(mx * my *
                            sizeof(int)); // also bad: owning raw * and malloc
        return data != nullptr;
    }

    // also bad: no reason to make cleanup a separate function
    void Cleanup() {
        if (data)
            free(data);
        data = nullptr;
    }
};

Picture picture(100, 0); // not ready-to-use picture here
// this will fail..
if (!picture.Init()) {
    puts("Error, invalid picture");
}
```
```cpp
// now have a invalid picture object instance.
// Example, good
class Picture {
    int mx;
    int my;
    vector<int> data;

    static int check_size(int size) {
        // invariant check
        Expects(size > 0);
        return size;
    }

  public:
    // even better would be a class for a 2D Size as one single parameter
    Picture(int x, int y)
        : mx(check_size(x)), my(check_size(y))
          // now we know x and y have a valid size
          ,
          data(mx * my) // will throw std::bad_alloc on error
    {
        // picture is ready-to-use
    }

    // compiler generated dtor does the job. (also see C.21)

    // ...
};

Picture picture1(100, 100);
// picture is ready-to-use here...

// not a valid size for y,
// default contract violation behavior will call std::terminate then
Picture picture2(100, 0);
// not reach here...
```
- Alternative: Always establish a class invariant in a constructor.
- Don't define an object before it is needed.


## NR.6: Don't place all cleanup actions at the end of a function and goto exitReason
- goto is error-prone. This technique is a pre-exception technique for RAII-like resource and error handling.

```cpp
// Example, bad
void do_something(int n)
{
    if (n < 100) goto exit;
    // ...
    int* p = (int*) malloc(n);
    // ...
    if (some_error) goto_exit;
    // ...
exit:
    free(p);
}
```
- Alternative: Use exceptions and RAII
- for non-RAII resources, use `finally`.

## NR.7: Don't make all data members protected
- **protected data is a source of errors.** protected data can be manipulated from an unbounded amount of code in various places. **protected data is the class hierarchy equivalent to global data.**
- Alternative: Make member data `public` or (preferably) `private`
