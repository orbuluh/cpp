# T: Templates and generic programming

- Generic programming is programming using types and algorithms parameterized by types, values, and algorithms.
- In C++, generic programming is supported by the template language mechanisms.
- Arguments to generic functions are **characterized by sets of requirements** on the argument types and values involved.
- In C++, these requirements are expressed by **compile-time predicates called concepts.**
- Templates can also be used for meta-programming; that is, programs that compose code at compile time.
- A central notion in generic programming is "concepts"; that is, requirements on template arguments presented as compile-time predicates.
