# Asynchronous Agents

An asynchronous agent is a **purely notional construct** that allows us to **reason about the context for, and composition of, asynchronous operations in a program.**

- The name “asynchronous agent” does not appear in the library, nor is it important which concrete mechanism (Such as chains of lambdas, coroutines, fibers, state machines, etc.) is used to compose the asynchronous operations in an agent.

An asynchronous agent is **a sequential composition of asynchronous operations**.

- Every asynchronous operation is considered to run as **a part of an asynchronous agent,** even if that agent contains only that single operation.
- An asynchronous agent is **an entity that may perform work concurrently with other agents**.
- Asynchronous agents are to asynchronous operations as threads are to synchronous operations.

We can visualize an asynchronous agent as follows:

Asynchronous agents alternately wait for an asynchronous operation to complete, and then run a completion handler for that operation. Within the context of an agent, these completion handlers represent indivisible units of schedulable work.

## Associated Characteristics and Associators

An asynchronous agent has associated characteristics that specify **how asynchronous operations should behave** when composed as part of that agent, such as:

- An **allocator**, which determines how the agent's asynchronous operations **obtain memory resources**.
- A **cancellation slot,** which determines how the agent's asynchronous operations support **cancellation**.
- An **executor**, which determines how the agent's **completion handlers will be queued and run.**

When an asynchronous operation is run within an asynchronous agent, its implementation may query these associated characteristics and use them to satisfy the requirements or preferences they represent.

- The asynchronous operation performs these queries by **applying associator traits to the completion handler.**
- Each characteristic has a corresponding associator trait.

An **associator trait** may be specialized for concrete completion handler types to:

- accept the default characteristic supplied by the asynchronous operation, returning this default as-is
return an unrelated implementation of the characteristic, or
- adapt the supplied default to introduce additional behavior required by the completion handler.

## Specification of an Associator

Given an associator trait named[2] `associated_R`, having:

- a source value s of type S, in this case the completion handler and its type,
- a set of type requirements (or a concept) R that define the syntactic and semantic requirements of the associated characteristic, and
- a candidate value c of type C that meets the type requirements R, which represents a default implementation of the associated characteristic, supplied by the asynchronous operation

the asynchronous operation uses the associator trait to compute:

- the type `associated_R<S, C>::type`, and
- the value `associated_R<S, C>::get(s, c)` that meet the requirements defined in R.

For convenience, these are also accessible via type alias `associated_R_t<S, C>` and free function `get_associated_R(s, c)`, respectively.

The trait's primary template is specified such that:

- if `S::R_type` is well-formed, defines a nested type alias type as `S::R_type`, and a static member function get that returns `s.get_R()`
- otherwise, if `associator<associated_R, S, C>::type` is well-formed and denotes a type, inherits from `associator<associated_R, S, C>`
- otherwise, defines a nested type alias type as `C`, and a static member function get that returns `c`.


## Child Agents

The asynchronous operations within an agent may themselves be implemented in terms of child agents. In Boost.Asio these asynchronous operations are referred to as **composed operations**.

As far as the parent agent is concerned, it is waiting for the completion of a single asynchronous operation. The asynchronous operations that constitute the child agent run in sequence, and when the final completion handler runs the parent agent is resumed.

![](../_pics/asio_async_child_agent.JPG)

- As with individual asynchronous operations, the asynchronous operations built on child agents must release their temporary resources prior to calling the completion handler.
- We may also **think of these child agents as resources that end their lifetimes before the completion handler is invoked.**

- When an asynchronous operation creates a child agent, it may propagate the associated characteristics of the parent agent to the child agent.
  - Typically, by specialising the associator trait and forwarding to the outer completion handler.
- These associated characteristics may then be recursively propagated through further layers of asynchronous operations and child agents.

This stacking of asynchronous operations replicates another property of synchronous operations:

|Property of synchronous operations | Equivalent property of asynchronous operations|
|--|--|
|Compositions of synchronous operations may be refactored to use child functions that run on the same thread (i.e. are simply called) without altering functionality.|Asynchronous agents may be refactored to use asynchronous operations and child agents that share the associated characteristics of the parent agent, without altering functionality.|

Finally, some asynchronous operations may be implemented in terms of multiple child agents that run concurrently. In this case, the asynchronous operation may choose to selectively propagate the associated characteristics of the parent agent.


## Executors

- **Every asynchronous agent has an associated executor**.
- An agent's executor determines how the agent's completion handlers are queued and ultimately run.

Example uses of executors include:

- Coordinating a group of asynchronous agents that operate on shared data structures, ensuring that the agents' completion handlers never run concurrently.
  - In Boost.Asio, this kind of executor is called a **strand**.
- Ensuring that agents are run on specified execution resource (e.g. a CPU) that is proximal to data or an event source (e.g. a NIC).
- Denoting a group of related agents, and so enabling dynamic thread pools to make smarter scheduling decisions (such as moving the agents between execution resources as a unit).
- Queuing all completion handlers to run on a GUI application thread, so that they may safely update user interface elements.
- Returning an asynchronous operation's default executor as-is, to run completion handlers as close as possible to the event that triggered the operation's completion.
- Adapting an asynchronous operation's default executor, to run code before and after every completion handler, such as logging, user authorization, or exception handling.
- Specifying a priority for an asynchronous agent and its completion handlers.

The asynchronous operations within an asynchronous agent use the agent's associated executor to:

- Track the existence of the work that the asynchronous operation represents, while the operation is outstanding.
- Enqueue the completion handler for execution on completion of an operation.
- Ensure that completion handlers do not run reentrantly, if doing so might lead to inadvertent recursion and stack overflow.

Thus, an asynchronous agent's associated executor represents **a policy of how, where, and when the agent should run**, specified as a cross-cutting concern to the code that makes up the agent.


## Allocators

**Every asynchronous agent has an associated allocator**.

- An agent's allocator is **an interface** used by the agent's asynchronous operations to obtain **per-operation stable memory resources** (POSMs).
- This name reflects the fact that the **memory is per-operation because the memory is only retained for the lifetime of that operation**, and **stable, because the memory is guaranteed to be available at that location throughout the operation.**

Asynchronous operations may utilize POSMs in a number of different ways:

- The operation doesn't require any POSMs. For example, the operation wraps an existing API that performs its own memory management, or is copying the long lived state into existing memory like a circular buffer.
The operation uses a single, fixed-size POSM for as long as the operation is outstanding. For example, the operation stores some state in a linked list.
The operation uses a single, runtime-sized POSM. For example, the operation stores a copy of a user-supplied buffer, or a runtime-sized array of iovec structures.
The operation uses multiple POSMs concurrently. For example, a fixed size POSM for a linked list plus a runtime-sized POSM for a buffer.
The operation uses multiple POSMs serially, which may vary in size.
Associated allocators allow users to treat POSM optimisation as a cross-cutting concern to the composition of asynchronous operations. Furthermore, using allocators as the interface to obtain POSMs grant substantial flexibility to both the implementers and users of asynchronous operations:

Users can ignore the allocator and accept whatever default strategy is employed by the application.
Implementers can ignore the allocator, especially if the operation is not considered performance-sensitive.
Users can co-locate POSMs for related asynchronous operations, for better locality of reference.
For compositions that involve serial POSMs of different sizes, memory usage need only be as great as the currently extant POSM. For example, consider a composition that contains a short-lived operation that uses large POSMs (connection establishment and handshake) followed by a long-lived operation that uses small POSMs (transferring data to and from the peer).
As noted previously, all resources must be released prior to calling the completion handler. This enables memory to be recycled for subsequent asynchronous operations within an agent. This allows applications with long-lived asynchronous agents to have no hot-path memory allocations, even though the user code is unaware of associated allocators.
