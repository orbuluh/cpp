# 105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour - Jonathan Boccara

## Why STL?

STL algorithm can make code more expressive

- Raising levels of abstraction
- Sometimes, it can be spectacular -> checkout C++ seasoning talk

Avoid common mistakes

- Off-by-one
- Empty loops
- naive complexity

Used by lots of people

- A common vocabulary
- Whatever the version of your compiler

## Longly islands

`std::for_each`


## Lands of Permutations

### Heaps

`std::make_heap(begin(numbers), end(numbers))`
